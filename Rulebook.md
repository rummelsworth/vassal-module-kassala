The "Moslem" player must attack and try to take the towns of Kassala and Udaka before the game's ten-turn time limit runs out.
The "Christian" player must try to prevent this.
Although the luck of the die can be a factor, victory will tend to go to the person who outplans and outmaneuvers his opponent.

Finally, *Kassala* is an introduction to contemporary wargames.
Wargaming fanatics who disdain anything less elaborate than *War in the East* may not recognize *Kassala* as belonging to the same genre.

But you'll find all the basic wargaming elements discussed in the previous chapter: a mapboard divided into hexagonal spaces, cardboard playing pieces with printed combat and movement factors, different unit types, zones of control, terrain effects, a Combat Results Table for resolving battles, and so on.
To be sure, ...
