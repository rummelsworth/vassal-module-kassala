# *Kassala:* An Introductory Wargame

It's all very well to read about wargames, to have the common terms and procedures defined and explained, but there's no substitute for seeing and playing one.
Hence, *Kassala*.

*Kassala* is a simulation&mdash;a re-creation of an actual, if obscure, sixteenth-century battle that took place between Moslem and Christian soldiers in northeastern Africa.
The playing pieces represent the forces&mdash;infantry, cavalry, and artillery&mdash;believed to have been there.
The wargame board is a modified map of the site of the battle.
